# finance-snapshot-svelte

My first working Svelte app with reactive UI and component composition.

## Get started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
